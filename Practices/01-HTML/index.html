		<h1><center>Best video game controllers</center></h1>
			<p><b>There have been many different ways of playing video games on a console (and sometimes PC) over the years. Some have been better than others. These are the two best controllers, chosen for comfort, control, and how compatible they are with PC gaming.</b></p>
		<h2><i>Dualshock 4 (PS4 controller)</i></h1>
			<p>
			<strong>DualShock 4</strong> is the <em>Sony PlayStation 4</em>'s controller. The controller features the following buttons: "PS" button, "SHARE" button, "OPTIONS" button, directional buttons, action buttons (&#9634;, &#9651;, &#9711;, &#10005;), shoulder buttons (R<sub>1</sub>/L<sub>1</sub>), triggers (R<sub>2</sub>/L<sub>2</sub>), analog stick click buttons (L<sub>3</sub>/R<sub>3</sub>) and a touch pad click button. These mark several changes from the <em>DualShock 3</em> and other previous <em>PlayStation</em> controllers. The "START" and "SELECT" buttons have been merged into a single "OPTIONS" button. A dedicated "SHARE" button allows players to upload screenshots and videos from their gameplay experiences. The joysticks and triggers have been redesigned based on developer input, with the ridged surface of the joysticks now featuring an outer ring surrounding the convex dome caps.<br>In early September 2016, <em>Sony</em> confirmed a second generation of <em>DualShock 4</em> controllers, known as the <em>DualShock V2</em>, which hosts slight improvements over the original <em>DualShock 4</em>, including USB communication, a longer battery life and the ability to see the light bar from the top of the touchpad. It released on September 15, 2016.</br>

		<h2><i>Xbox One Controller</i></h2>
			<p>
			<strong>Xbox One Controller</strong> is the primary controller for the <em>Microsoft Xbox One</em> console. The controller features ten digital buttons, a syncing button, two analog triggers, two analog sticks and a digital D-pad. The right face of the controller features four digital actions buttons; a green "A" button, red "B" button, blue "X" button, and yellow "Y" button. The lower right houses the right analog stick, in lower left is a digital D-pad and on the left face is the left analog stick. Both analog sticks can also be "clicked in" to activate a digital button beneath. In the center of the controller face are digital "View", "Menu" and "Guide" buttons. The "Guide" button is labelled with the <em>Xbox</em> logo, and is used to turn on the console/controller and to access the <em>Dashboard</em>. Unlike the <em>Xbox 360</em> controller, the <em>Xbox One</em> controller features a white backlit <em>Xbox</em> logo on its "Guide" button and does not feature the "ring of light" that served as an indicator for the controller's assigned number (1 to 4). The left and right "shoulders" each feature a digital shoulder button, or "bumper", and an analog trigger.<br>On June 9, 2015, <em>Microsoft</em> unveiled a revised version of the standard controller. Its shoulder buttons were redesigned for improved responsiveness, a 3.5 mm headphone jack was added near the controller's expansion port, and support for wireless firmware updates was added. A third revision of the controller was introduced alongside the <em>Xbox One S</em>, an updated model of the <em>Xbox One</em> console, unveiled in June 2016. It features textured grips, and additionally supports <em>Bluetooth</em>, which allows it to be used wirelessly on Bluetooth-enabled PCs without the need for the proprietary <em>Wireless Adapter</em>. Users can also custom-order this controller revision via the "Xbox Design Lab" service, with their choice of colors, and an optional inscription of their <em>Xbox Live</em> screen name for an additional fee.</br>
